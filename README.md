# TrumpKlon

TrumpKlon is great art project and a great personal Twitter bot based on Raspberry Pi technology.
TrumpKlon automatically creates tweets that resemble the spelling style of Donald Trump.
The tweet generator of TrumpKlon is based on real Donald Trump tweets. 
They are real. It's fantastic.


TrumpKlon installation is straightforward. It's easy. Really easy.
All you need is a Raspberry Pi, a fresh SD card and a Twitter account. 
That's all it takes. Incredibly easy.
For details on installation, see the [step-by-step instructions](https://github.com/blinkgestalten/TrumpKlon/wiki/TrumpKlon-Installation) in the TrumpKlon Wiki.


Other Twitter bots try to generate convincing language. 
They try hard, but fail ridiculously. Total losers. 
TrumpKlon doesn't. It doesn't even try to be convincing. 
TrumpKlon's language is based on great underdeveloped 
artificial brain simulation techniques. It's all fake. Total desaster. 
But it's funny and entertaining. It's true. You'll love it.
Therefore TrumpKlon is the greatest Twitter bot in the world.


TrumpKlon is OpenSource. Well at least the binaries are free. 
The source is strictly confidential. All secret. Don't even ask for it.
But the binaries are totally free. Cost nothing. Zero. It's ridiculous.

Since TrumpKlon is free, everyone can have one. Or two. Take as much as you want.
Believe me, one TrumpKlon should be in every household. Can't wait to see it.
Think of this: millions of TrumpKlon devices around the world - it's gonna be great.
It's gonna be huge. Absolutely fantastic. 
An enormous amount of Trump tweets everywhere. You'll love it.

# Project History

TrumpKlon is a spinoff project of ElektroKlon, an art(ificial) product for automated generation of private information for everyone. If TrumpKlon is great, ElektroKlon is even greater. It's not just Trump, it's everything you can think of. You'll love it. Great stuff.
