How could you possibly contribute to the TrumpKlon project?  

Well, this project is a bit unusual since it is no classic GitHub source code project.  
TrumpKlon is an art project and art projects mainly live on the participation of the audience.

So you are invited to install TrumpKlon and to share the news that you did it.  
Apart from that: please enter an issue if you are running into real bugs.

If you are running into Raspberry Pi issues when setting up TrumpKlon,  
then please ask a friend to help you. We can't handle support like this. 

Please also refrain from submitting feature requests.  
There is just no point in submitting feature requests for artworks ...  
... or did you ever hear of an artist who changed his work after hearing about complaints from the audience ;-)
